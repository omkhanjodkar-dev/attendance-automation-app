This is a comprehensive, automated attendance system. It consists of a Flutter mobile application for students and faculty, and a Python backend for the business logic and data management.

Key components:

Flutter Frontend (attendance_automation):
Provides separate interfaces for "students" and "faculty".
Uses Wi-Fi SSID scanning (wifi_scan) and possibly geolocation (geolocator) to verify a student's presence.
Features secure login and session management.

Python Backend (FastAPI):
Authentication Server (auth_server): Manages user login, logout, and token-based authentication.
Resource Server (resource_server): Handles core functionalities like starting/stopping attendance sessions, managing the Wi-Fi SSID for classes, and recording attendance.

The overall architecture is a client-server model where the Flutter app communicates with the FastAPI backend. It appears to be a well-structured and complete project.
